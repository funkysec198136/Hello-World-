# Hello-World-
Learning repository   repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.
 I am a single mother of 3 children, ages 2,11,13. I love them more than anyone or anything ever. I am also a very knowledge-hungry person, and recently I have learned that computer progriamming has been an expertise of not only my maternal grandmother but also my paternal grandfather! I have been questioning myself as to what I really feel is my "niche" or passion in life and I have concluded to the obvious: computer science and technology. Now on my way to gain knowledge and experience in the world of computers and all related subjects and technology. Github is my starting point of my journey towards learning, knowing, creating, developing, inventing/improving, perfecting, sharing/showing/successful productions, introducing new and  life changing ideas and technology for a better world.
